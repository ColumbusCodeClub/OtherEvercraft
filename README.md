#Welcome to OtherEvercraft#

##Requirements##
This kata was created by user guyroyse and can be found at [guyroyse/evercraft-kata](https://github.com/guyroyse/evercraft-kata)

##Building Project##
To get started, clone the project and then from the root directory of the project run the command
`./gradlew` or however you run batch scripts in windows

From there you can, from the root directory again, run `./gradlew eclipse` to pull in dependency and create the project files for the project. After that you should be good to go!

##Feature Branching##
If you are going to be working on a new feature it is recommended that you create a new branch, complete all work on that branch, and then review that branch with someone else before merging it in to master. This is a collaborative project so please _play nicely with others_ :smile:
